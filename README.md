# AUGUST-HACKATHON
My very first hackathon! While designing this portfolio, I felt like a fish out of water but welcomed the challenge😁. Here's to many more👏🏾.

The folder contains all the images and pdfs I have used in the webpage design.

This website is my first digital portfolio, showcasing my architectural projects and web development skills. The site includes:

  Welcome Section: A brief introduction with a profile image.
  Education: Information about educational background and a downloadable CV.
  Languages: A list of programming languages and skills.
  Projects: A detailed view of architectural projects with images and descriptions.
  Contact: Links for email and phone, allowing easy communication.
  Footer: Copyright information.

  I first began by designing how I wanted the homepage to look like and tried to replicate the same with HTML and CSS. The reference pdf is provided albeit some things changed along the way😅.
  This is still a work  in progress and I will gradually improve on it.
